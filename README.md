# Module 9 SVG Logo Maker

This CLI app prompts users to input parameters for a simple SVG logo they would like to create for their projects.  It will then take those parameters and generate the SVG code that can be used to generate a logo.

## Installation

To install this app you will need to clone the repo to your local machine.  Then install the required dependencies (inquirer and jest) by typing 'npm i' into your command line.  Next simply type "node index.js" to start the program.  Requires NODE to work.
    
## Usage/Examples

If you would like to generate a very simple SVG (scalable vector graphics) logo for your project follow the installation guide and run the program.

All parameters of your logo will be input using your CLI.  After all prompts have been completed the script will output the SVG code in three places:

    1) in your command line
    2) in a folder within the repo called 'Examples'. You will be prompted to enter a filename at the end of the questions.
    3) written directly into an index.html so that you can view what your logo looks like in the browser.






## Lessons Learned

There were no major lessons learned here.  However, the process of making all parts of this app shed serious light on what we had been learning in class.  It helped to see how all the pieces interact with eachother.

Though I will say that one thing I learned is that to be very mindful of how what I change will effect other pieces of the program.  As we add more and more connections and dependencies to our project this becomes more and more true.  There was a time in this project when I realized that I was trying to do to much with my prompts.  Changing the way the prompts were given and saved sent major ripples to every part of the project.  The tests were probably the only way I had to chase down what was going wrong.
